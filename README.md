# Proliant fan Controller

Cross platform fan controller script for proliant fan mod

This code is not tested with ILO yet since I havent found an extra ethernet cable. It should work though?
For configuring check exampleconfig.ini

This script needs pyserial and wmi on windows or psutil on linux to work.
